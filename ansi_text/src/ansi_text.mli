(** Library for parsing text that contains ANSI escape codes.

    Implements most of the standard Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) spec through the
    [Style] module and most of the Control Sequence Introducer (CSI) spec through the
    [Control] module.

    More details on SGR:

    The primary type [Ansi_text.t] is defined in [text_with_ansi.ml], and represents text
    as a list of [`Text], [`Style], and [`Control] elements. The functions defined in
    [input_output.ml] handle parsing to/from strings. These serve three primary purposes:
    1) stripping out ANSI codes or rendering them in a more human-readable form for use in
       expect-tests.
    2) performing text-wrapping and similar operations that depend on string-length in a
       way that ignores ANSI codes and respects Unicode character widths.
    3) simplifying ANSI codes in text that contains lots of them.

    The [Text_with_style_ranges] module is intended for applying styles to specific ranges
    within a text or for parsing text with such styles. This is used by the version of
    patdiff4 in the Fe web-ui to extract the ranges of the styles that patdiff applied. *)
